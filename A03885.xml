            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL the Controuerſyes of this tyme may be reduced to two heades: for eyther they are certayne generall principles &amp; foundations of our faith and Religion, or they are particuler queſtions appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ſame. Amongſt other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Principles there be two, about which is the greateſt contention at this day: the one is, the Word of God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Church: we will firſt ſpeake of the word of God, and afterwardes of the Church: and laſtly we will examine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particuler Controuerſy, if God ſhall graunt vs life and health.</p>

                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:4518:6"/>2. Two things do now adayes hold many in errour. The one is a falſe opinion that many haue, who thinke it a matter of little importance, whether they giue credit or no to many things taught by the Roman Church: which daungerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion may be taken out of the mindes of all faithfull people, by that which we ſhall deliuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the word of God, and the Church, for thereby it ſhall eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, that al thinges are firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be belieued, which the Roman Church belieueth, and that without this faith no man can hope to be ſaued. The other is, that ſuch as deſire to find out the true faith in euery particuler Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy, are oftentimes ſo hindred by the ſleights and falſhoods of our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, as it will be very hard for them to diſcerne that which is true, from that which is falſe. Wherfore we will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in euery particuler Controuerſy, to ſet downe the true ſtate of the queſtion. Afterward we will lay open the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholike doctrine. And la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly we will plainly and briefly anſwere the chiefe obiections of our Aduerſaries, whether they be drawne out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or taken from the Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And becauſe our Aduerſaries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4518:6"/> boaſt and brag of the written Word of God, pretending out of it only to proue their doctrine &amp; impugne ours: our chiefe care ſhalbe to ſhew, that the Catholike and Roman faith is both eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and ſtrongly to be confirmed out of the wrirten Word of God, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Aduerſaries to haue no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation at all in the holy Scriptures, but is manifeſtly oppoſite &amp; repugnant ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: yet ſo, as we will ſet downe the vniforme conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the auncient Church to be agreeing with vs in euery Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy, leauing the more ample ſearch of antiquity vnto others, to whome we will referre the Reader, ſetting downe their particuler names; ſo loath we are that this booke of ours ſhould grow too great: and for the ſame reaſon we haue thought good to omit many arguments which might be drawne out of the holy Scriptures for confirmation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, contenting our ſelues to ſet downe only the more ſolide and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofes, becauſe we are reſolued to be as briefe as may be.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The firſt cauſe, is for that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries eyther contemne, or make little

                  <p n="5">5. Heerehence it is, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries do inſert into the new Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                  <p n="6">6. The ſecond cauſe is, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing more then in their tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to depart from the vulgar edition, the which ſeeing it is moſt ſincere and correct, they, which almoſt in all thinges leane it, muſt needes fall into many errors.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p>OVR Aduerſaries conuinced by the truth it ſelfe, confeſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, that the vulgar Edition not only is to be preferred before all other latin Editions, but euen before the <hi>Greeke</hi> text of the new <hi>Teſtament,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text of the old: for in many places reiecting them, they follow our vulgar tranſlation, as may be ſeene in the Latin edition in the Chapters 8. 9. 10. 13.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4518:18"/> notwithſtanding that in many other places they exceedingly inueigh againſt, it, and with great hoſtility oppugne it, partily for that they ſee the ſame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict in many places their errors, and partly alſo, for that they labour by all meanes to peruert the text of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by their new verſion, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeake in fauour of their error, which they cannot do, if the authority of the old<note place="margin">Calu. in Antid.

Indeed <hi>Caluins</hi> &amp; <hi>Luthers</hi> diſciples find fault with many other places in the vulgar edition, both of the old and new Teſtament, but we will lay foure generall grounds, out of which all their arguments may be eaſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt is: If our Aduerſaires will needes haue the now preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church condemned for following and authorizing the vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they muſt needes alſo condemne the whole auncient Church, and all the Fathers who liued the firſt ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no other interpretation of the old Teſtament as authenticall, then that of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Interpreters, which much more departeth from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text now extant, then our vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi> as our Aduerſaries themſelues confeſſe: wherfore if the <hi>Roman Church</hi> be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the vulgar Edition, much more the <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> for the verſion of the <hi>Septuagint:</hi> and heereof it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth further, that the Church is not to be condemned, which followeth a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4518:19"/> of the Scripture, which in ſome thinges may be amended, ſo long as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be found in it, which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant eyther to fayth or good manners. For otherwiſe the auncient Church had erred in retayning the verſion of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which was corrupted in ſome places, but thoſe corruptions were not in<note place="margin">

                     </hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>that we muſt not depart from the Church for errors of little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, the ignorance whereof neyther doth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Religion, nor preiudice our ſaluation.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore albeit there ſhould be ſome ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the vulgar Edition, yet were not<note place="margin">Rom. 1 v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this may ſerue for anſwere to our Aduerſaries argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they obiect certayne light faults of the vulgar Edition, which haue crept into it, eyther by the negligence of the printers, or by any other accident. As alſo what our Aduerſaries obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> may heerby be co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be very weake: for ſeeing that no other verſion is followed in it, then that auncient verſion of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> they cannot condemne vs, vnleſſe they will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4518:19"/> condemne the whole primitiue Church togeather with vs, yea the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, who followed the ſame verſion, is as ſhewed in the 11. Chapter of the Latin Edition of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſecond ground. A good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter doth not tye himſelfe to tranſlate word for word, ſeeing that euery tongue hath his proper phraſes, and manner of ſpeach, but contenteth himſelfe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the true ſenſe and meaning of that which he tranſlateth. Wherefore all our Aduerſaries argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are nothing worth, by which they proue, that certayne places of the vulgar edition are ſomewhat other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Hebrew and Greeke, ſo that the ſenſe of the whole period be one and the ſame, as moſt of the places are which they carpe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> in the vulgar Edition.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The third ground. The places of holy Scripture are of two ſortes: ſome are cleare &amp; manifeſt, as almoſt all are which ſet downe the hiſtory of the old and new Teſtament. Others are obſcure, and full of difficulty, as are many places in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> Now, if the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſuch places as are euident and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, do interprete rightly all of them, and in ſuch places of Scripture as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4518:20"/> expreſſe a ſenſe and meaning agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Letter, though he come ſhort of the beſt ſenſe, and that there might be a better giuen, he is not therefore to be thought to haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l and profound is the ſenſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> holy Scripture, eſpecially in ſuch places as are obſcure, as it is not eaſy for any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to iudge, which is the beſt ſenſe. Nay if we muſt interprete a new, vntill wee haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ath neyther ſatisfyed eyther the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the worke, or his owne deſire. Out of which ground, we anſwere to that which our Aduerſaries obiect, to wit, that there are many places of the vulgar Edition, which might much better and much more cleerly haue been tranſlated: for it is ſufficient that they are well, and rightly tranſlated.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:4518:20"/>5. The fourth ground. We are not to reprehend the tranſlations of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, only becauſe they differ one from another, ſo long as they are not contrary the one to the other: and in this the holy Scripture differeth from other prophane writings. For euen as the holy Ghoſt in diuers places of holy Scripture teacheth thinges different, but not repugnant: ſo the ſame holy Ghoſt can in one place, &amp; in the ſame words teach diuers things. And heerhence it is, that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth<note place="margin">1. <hi>p. q. 1. art. vlt.</hi>
                     </note> well, as did <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> before him, that of one &amp; the ſame place of Scripture there may be many litterall ſenſes. For where as the litterall ſenſe is that which the author intendeth, and the proper and chiefe author of the holy Scripture is God himſelfe, whoſe intention and meaning is not tied to one verity only, as is mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but he in one and the ſame moment comprehendeth all things; there is no doubt, but that he in the ſame words and at the ſame tyme, can intimate vnto vs diuers things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The which thing is excellently declared by <hi>S. Auguſtin,</hi> for hauing ſaid that<note place="margin">Aug. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that without all doubt God, who is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4518:21"/> the principall author of the Scriptures did ſo. <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>ſeeing thou art God, and not flesh and bloud, if man he short ſighted, can it be hidden from thy ſpirit which will lead me into the right land, whatſoeuer thou waſt in thoſe words to reueale to poſterity, howſoeuer he by whome they were ſpoken, thought peraduenture but of one ſenſe only, amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt many other no leſſe true;</hi> ſo <hi>S. Auguſtin.</hi> Seeing therfore there are diuers litterall ſenſes of one and the ſame place, one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter may follow one ſenſe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpreter another, ſo long as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them do ſay any thing not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God, but both the one ſenſe and the other is godly, and conformable to other places of Scripture. And this maketh much for the dignity of the Scriptures, and profit of the Church, according to that which <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">

                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p>OVR Aduerſaries often require vs to proue all that which we ſay out of the written Word of God, but when we cite the ſame in expreſſe tearmes, they haue many wayes by which they depraue it. Wherfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make an end of this Controuerſy concerning the written Word, it ſhall not be from the purpoſe briefly to detect ſuch their corruptions; partly to the end that no man be deceaued by them, and partly that euery man may vnderſtand nothing to be ſo plainely and clearely ſet downe in the written VVord, which by the Commentaries of crafty and ſubtile wittes may not be weakned and made of little force, if no regard be had to the authority and iudgment of the Church. And that no man may thinke that I herin calumniate them, or deale leſſe ſincerely with them, I will ſet downe out of their owne writings ſome one or two exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pls of each manner of corrupting, wherof many will occure in ech Controuerſy.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4518:34"/> places alleadged out of the written Word, is to ſay, that the originall text is corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, and what is alleadged is crept out of the margent into the text, whereof ſee many examples in the 12. and 18.

                  <p n="5">5. The third thing which is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is, that our Aduerſaries being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by truth, doe acknowledge that many things were deliuered vnto vs by the<note place="margin">

                  <p n="6">6.

For according to our Aduerſaries doctrine all thinges neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation are expreſſed in holy Scripture: but the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all things
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4518:51"/> belonging to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> is altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary to ſaluation, therefore the obſeruation of theſe thinges is expreſſed in Scriptures, or els truly many thinges neceſſary to ſaluation muſt be ſought for out of the Scriptures. Moreouer that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy</hi> is vnlawfull, is a point of faith: but this, as <hi>Beza</hi> confeſſeth, is not expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſely contayned in Scriptures, therfore all the pointes of faith are not expreſſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The firſt point of faith is, that the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> may only be giuen in water.

                     </note> that water is the fit matter of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> but they do not proue that there can be no other matter.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When <hi>Beza</hi> did conſider this well, leaſt that his foreſayd principle, that we muſt belieue nothing but Scripture, might ſeeme to be called in queſtion, he was not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4518:51"/> a ſhamed to write, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> might be giuen in any liquour, and by this meanes it wilbe true and lawfull <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> though it be giuen in milke, wyne, yea in Inke, or any other filthy liquour.

                  <p n="6">6. Furthermore, to the end that <hi>Beza</hi> might more eaſily perſwade the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant common people to admit this his ſtrang paradox, he addeth preſently a very grieuous ſlaunder againſt the Catholike Doctors. <hi>Let water be wanting,</hi> ſaith Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,<note place="margin">

For in nothing can one more eaſily, or more often erre, then in theſe illations. The which may proceed of many cauſes; ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the illation it ſelfe is bad and Sophiſticall, or becauſe the place of Scripture from whence it is gathered, is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4518:57"/> falſified by ſome falſe expoſition therof, or becauſe the propoſition which is aſſumed and adioyned to the wordes of Scripture is falſe and ambiguous, or becauſe one or more wordes in that collection are vſed doubtfully, that is to ſay, in one ſenſe in the premiſes, and in another in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; or laſtly becauſe there hapneth ſome errour to be in the collection which maketh it weake, Sophiſticall, and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Beſides that, there are ſo many and ſo contrary illations of diuers men, that the authority of the Church is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather neceſſary in maters of faith, that there may ariſe a certayne and an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faith of theſe matters, of which ſort Traditions are, that is to ſay, the doctrine of the whole Church.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But when one belieueth ſuch an illation with a diuine or Catholike faith, he muſt needes know two thinges, the one is, that the expreſſe place of Scripture from whence this concluſion is deduced, muſt certainly be well vnderſtood by him which diſputeth: the other is, that he who maketh ſuch a deduction and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, can neyther deceiue others, nor be deceyued himſelfe.

                  <p n="2">2. But this argument is erroneous, and the weaknes thereof is very great for many cauſes. Firſt becauſe in thoſe words there is no mention made of the Scripture, nor of the written word of God, but only of the word preached and deliuered <hi>viua voce. Thou shalt not add</hi> (ſayth the Scripture) <hi>to the word that I ſpeake vnto you,</hi> he doth not

                  <p n="3">3. Moreouer in theſe words the holy Scripture doth not only ſpeake of matters of fayth to be belieued, but alſo of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and cuſtomes to be done and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: but our Aduerſaries themſelues confeſſe, that theſe cuſtomes may be added by the authority of the Church, yea they haue ordeined themſelues very many, the which they chang euen yet when they pleaſe. <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo acknowledgeth that<note place="margin">Calu. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p n="4">4. That alſo according to the phraſe of Scripture is ſaid to be added to the word of God which is contrary &amp; oppoſite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it.

                        <hi>Suprac.</hi> 3.</note> ſaid before. But al theſe are diſtinct things from thoſe which are expreſly written in holy Scripture. For the antecedent whereby ſome other thing may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is diſtinct from that which is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For it were a ridiculous illation, if one and the ſame thing ſhould be inferred from it ſelfe. But that which is inferred in a good collection is neuer contrary to the antecedent. The Apoſtle therefore ſpeaketh of doctrine contrary to his, and not abſolutly of any other diſtinct do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And in this ſenſe the Fathers doe often ſay, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirmed in this place that nothing was to be taught beſids that<note place="margin">Auguſt.

For in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4518:66"/> this manner he writeth, when he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his ſchollers to take heed of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> &amp; other heretikes,<note place="margin">

                  <p>AMONG the other argumentes of our Aduerſaries this is one, that we cannot know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which are the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Apoſtles, ſeing that many Heretikes in times paſt pretended alſo that their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſyes were agreing to Apoſtolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4518:198"/> mouth might continue the longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any falſification or corruption. But we anſwere to this their reaſon: that the auncient Heretikes alſo by ſuppoſed and falſe Scriptures which they attributed falſely to the Apoſtles, did confirme and proue their hereſies.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Many thinges,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine, were alleadged by heretikes, as though they were the ſayings of the Prophets and Apoſtles. But yet for all that, they were not iudged to be the moſt certaine and Canonicall Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Traditions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles may ſo certainly and eaſily be known from ſuppoſed and falſe Traditions, as the Canonical Scriptures may be knowne from the Apocriphall: for they are both knowne by the ſame meanes and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that is to ſay, by the authority, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and teſtimony of the Catholike Church, which neyther can deceiue any, nor be decevued her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And albeit, ſpeaking of humane matters the Scripture is more certaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tradition alone, yet it happeneth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in matters concerning God, becauſe in theſe there is the authority of God, and the continuall aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt hath place, which doth not ſuffer the Church to erre: and hence it is, that the Tradition only of the Church which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4518:69"/> is not ſo much written in paper, as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">1. <hi>ad Cor. 5. v.</hi> 3. 4.</note> in the hartes of Chriſtians, is a moſt certayne, and faithfull keeper of all the pointes of our diuine faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Diuers other Arguments of our Aduerſaries againſt the viſible Church, are confuted.</head>
                  <p>THE third argument of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries wherby they impugne the viſible Church, is this: The Holy Scripture compareth the Church to the Moone, but the Moone doth often tymes not appeare, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the new moone, and in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips. I anſwere, that we muſt not ſeeke for a ſimilitude or likeneſſe in all thinges betwixt the Church and the moone, for otherwiſe the Church of Chriſt ſhould neyther ſee, not vnderſtand, nor belieue,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4518:85"/> and it ſhould be altogeather without life as the Moone is. But in this matter that ſimilitude or likneſſe betwixt the Church and the moone, is only to be ſought out, in which the Scripture compareth the Church to the moone; but the Scripture doth not compare the Church to the Moone as ſhe is a mutable planet, but as ſhe is beautifull in her ſelfe. <hi>Beautifull</hi> (ſaith<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant. 6. v.</hi> 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Salomon) is the moone,</hi> but in mutuability the Scriptur compareth <hi>a foole</hi> to the moone, but not the Church. <hi>A foole</hi> (ſaith the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl. 27. v.</hi> 12.</note> Wiſeman) <hi>is changed as the moone.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Church of Chriſt is not compared to euery moone, but only to the moone,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa. 60. v.</hi> 26.</note> when ſhe is in her fulneſſe &amp; perfection, yea to the moone which is neuer dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed nor fayleth: he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are thoſe wordes of the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> which <hi>Caluin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth<note place="margin">Cal. in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la verba<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> are to be vnderſtood of the Church, <hi>Thy ſunne shall neuermore be ſet, and thy moone shall not be diminished</hi> (or as <hi>Caluin</hi> tranſlateth it) <hi>shall not be hidden.</hi> Laſtly S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the moone is vnder the feete of the Church,</hi> that therby we may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the Church of Chriſt by the vertue of the ſunne (to wit Chriſt himſelfe, where withall ſhe is wholy inueſted and<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apo. 12. v.</hi> 1.</note> adorned) is free from all mutability in matters of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:4518:85"/>2. The fourth argument. Theſe thinges which we belieue by faith are inuiſible, but by faith we belieue there is a Catholike Church, as appeareth by the Apoſtles Creed, therefore the Catholike Church is inuiſible and not viſible. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that this is a weake argument, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo vſeth it. For if it were not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would proue that the holy Scripture were alſo inuiſible, becauſe we belieue alſo the holy Scripture by faith, yea it would alſo proue euen our Aduerſaries Church to be as yet inuiſible, for they as yet belieue their Church by faith, and yet they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that their Church is now viſible. And truly if their Church had remayned ſtil inuiſible, they had neuer cauſed ſo many tumults in the Chriſtian Common-wealth. But certainly euen as in the holy Scriptures we ſee one thinge and belieue another, we ſee the letters &amp; characters, the which the <hi>Infidels</hi> alſo ſee, but we belieue that the Scripture is moſt true in all thinges, the which they do not belieue: ſo we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that the Church of Chriſt is extant, the which alſo the Infidels do ſee; for <hi>Turkes</hi> &amp; <hi>Iewes</hi> do very well know that there is a <hi>Pope,</hi> and that there are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Princes, and Chriſtian Nations: but we belieue that this Church which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:4518:86"/> we ſee is an holy Church, is gouerned &amp; directed by the holy Ghoſt, and that ſhe cannot erre in matters of faith, all which the Infidels do not belieue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fifth argument. None is in the Church but by faith, but faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, therfore the Church alſo is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I anſwere, that this is a very weake conſequence, for otherwiſe we might reaſon thus: None is man but by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule, but the ſoule of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the vſe of reaſon, is inuiſible, therfore the whole man alſo is inuiſible. Alſo, no Scripture is to be accounetd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but by the authority of God, but this authority is inviſible, therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alſo is inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſible. For it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that a thing may be called viſible, that the chiefe part or reaſon thereof be viſible, but it ſufficieth if any part therof be viſible, as manifeſtly appeareth in all viſible ſubſtances, for their chiefe partes, to wit, their ſubſtantiall matter and forme are thinges inuiſible.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Secondly I anſwere, that the faith wherby a man is made a member of the viſible Church is not only an interiour faith which is not to be ſeene, but that which is euidently ſeene and declared by exteriour ſignes: as for example by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4518:86"/> publikely the ſaid faith, by recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacraments, and ſuch other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour acts. The which is ſo true, that this exteriour profeſſion of our faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without the interiour faith, ſufficeth that a man become a member of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> well proueth:<note place="margin">

Wherefore to the end they may ſtill haue ſome corner or hole to ſlip out at, they affirme, that the true Church of Chriſt both hath erred, &amp; ſtill doth erre in points of faith. Then the which nothing certainly is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, eſpecially ſeing that they affirme that it hath erred not in things of ſmall

And laſtly, that it hath donne thus, not only for the ſpace of one yeare, but for a thouſand or at leaſt 900. yeares. All which how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd they are, we will now declare.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to the end that all which we are to ſay hereafter of this matter may be the better vnderſtood, we muſt note heere that when we affirme that the Church cannot erre in fayth, that by this word (<hi>fayth</hi>) we vnderſtand not only that inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible fayth which is in our mind, but alſo viſible, that is to ſay, the publike doctrine of the whole Church, which is propoſed or ſet downe to be belieued of all. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we affirme, that the Church cannot erre in matters of fayth, we affirme alſo, that the doctrine or points of fayth, the which the Church of God ſetteth downe as the moſt certayne and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word of God, cannot be falſe, but the very word of God it ſelfe, which I will

                  <p n="4">4. The ſecond argument is deduced out of moſt cleare teſtimonyes of holy Scripture, which teach that the Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre in faith. For firſt Chriſt himſelf<note place="margin">

For none of theſe erreth, when it is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God. But a Pillar is that which neceſſarily and alwaies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth that which it ſtrengthneth, and whoſe pillar it is: wherfore the Church

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal. 11. v.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the Father.</hi> For by theſe wordes he ſheweth that ſome which are in the Church are called to the diuine offices by men, and ſome by God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is, that thoſe who are taken to Eccleſiaſticall offices by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vocation, they receyue their calling and authority from the Church. For this ordinary vocation is not done but by the miniſters of the Church. But the whole Controuerſy is of the extraordinary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For thoſe who in this age haue brought in new opinions, ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4518:98"/> deſtitute of the ordinary vocation, they fly vnto the extraordinary, the which, ſay they, muſt not be ſubiect to the cenſure, and approbation of the Church, wherof they know themſelues to be deſtitute. But we on the other ſide affirme, that the extraordinary vocation alſo muſt neceſſarily be confirmed and approued by ſuch as haue ordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church of God. And we know very well, that our Aduerſaries haue not truly this extraordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as afterward we will declare more at large. But ſuppoſe we graunt them to haue this extraordinary calling, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by theſe enſuing arguments we will manifeſtly proue, that it muſt needs be confirmed and approued by thoſe who haue their ordinary vocation in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The firſt argument. <hi>S. Paul</hi> was immediatly and extraordinarily called by<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ad Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. 1. v.</hi> 1.</note> God, as he writeth himſelfe: and yet he was ſent to <hi>Ananias</hi> who had the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vocation, that by him he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and baptized. And afterwards<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act. 9. v.</hi> 7.</note> together with <hi>S. Barnabas</hi> he was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the impoſition of hands, by thoſe who were the ordinary Paſtors of the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act. 13. v.</hi> 3.</note> Church. Laſtely he writeth, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4518:99"/> to the reuelation which he had, he<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. v. 1. &amp;</hi> 2.</note> went to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>conſerred the Ghoſpell which he preached,</hi> with the viſible Church and ordinary Paſtor of the ſame, leaſt he might ſeeme <hi>to haue runne, or laboured in vaine:</hi> they therefore who refuſe the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the viſible Church, albeit they be neuer ſo extraordinarily called ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they doe but labour in vayne.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſecond argument. We muſt not eaſily beleeue euery one who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe to be extraordinarily ſent by God, according to that admonition of <hi>S. Iohn: Belieue not euery ſpirit, but proue the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 4. 4. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>ſpirits whether they be of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> But this proofe or triall cannot be better done then by Chriſts Church, which is, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, the <hi>pillar, and ground of truth.</hi> The which alſo S. <hi>Iohn</hi> clearly ſheweth by the words following, when he ſayth, <hi>he that knoweth God heareth vs, he that is not of God, heareth vs not: in this we know the ſpirit of truth, and the ſpirit of error.</hi> It is therefore a moſt certaine rule wherby this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary vocation is examined, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, whether it will ſubmit it ſelfe to the approbation of the viſible Church, and will heare her or no? For he who heareth the Church, hath the ſpirit of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4518:99"/> truth, and the true extraordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he who will not heare the Church, hath the ſpirit of error and the falſe extraordinary vocation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The third argument. The holy Ghoſt neuer contradicteth himſelfe, for otherwiſe (which God forbid) he ſhould not be the ſpirit of truth, but of falſhood: for truth is neuer repugnant to truth, but to falſhood: ſeeing that therfore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the ordinary vocation is from the holy Ghoſt, that extraordinary can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be oppoſite vnto it, which is truly from the holy Ghoſt. For otherwiſe God ſhould be oppoſite vnto himſelfe, which were impiety to thinke; wherfore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth, that the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vocation muſt agree with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and be ſubiect vnto it; as alſo it muſt eſtabliſh and confirme, but not impugne it. Hereupon ſayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>the ſpirit of the Prophets are ſubiect to the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>ad Cor. 14. v.</hi> 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Prophets:</hi> if they be ſubiect to the Prophets, much more to the whole Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The fourth argument. There would ariſe a greate confuſion in the Church of God, if euery one were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to preach and adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that ſhould affirme himſelfe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4518:100"/> to be extraordinarily called without any other examine or approbation of the Church. For ſo euery phantaſticall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low might freely bragge and affirme himſelfe to be extraordinarily called by God. And vnder that pretence and title might preach, adminiſter the Sacraments and exerciſe all other Eccleſiaſticall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. Some of our Aduerſaries doe heere obiect vnto vs the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for, ſay they, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was neuer approued by the auncient Church of the Iewes, wheras notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it was extraordinary. But this is a very friuolus and odious compariſon of Chriſt and his Apoſtles with their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. For it was expreſſely foretould by the Prophets, that Chriſt was to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the old Law, and the carnall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſucceſſion thereof, and that he was to ordayne another more excellent and ſpirituall, the which he effected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Wherefore ſeing that now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had another farre more excellent vocation inſtituted by Chriſt, there was no reaſon they ſhould aske any vocation from <hi>Moyſes.</hi> But we read no where that the vocation ordained by Chriſt was to be abrogated by any other whoſoeuer: but contrarywiſe the holy Scriptures do plainely teach, that the vocation ordained

But becauſe our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4518:102"/> goe about to obſcure this great and renowned prayſe of our Church, we will treat of this matter more exactly: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap. 13. ſeq.</hi> §. 16.</note> becauſe this is a queſtion of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſeing that theron dependeth our whole faith. For euery thing rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and dependeth of his foundation. Moreouer, heereby is declared the great excellency and authority of the Church. Hence alſo other opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our faith are to be proued which our Aduerſaries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; their errors confuted, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues very eaſily conuinced. And that the true ſtate of this Controuerſie may the better be vnderſtood, three thinges are to noted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt is, that euery ſcience and doctrine hath her grounds &amp; principles, out of which all other thinges are dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, proued, and do depend: wherefore we muſt heere diligently examine and ſearch out the true principles of our faith, leaſt otherwiſe our faith become doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vncertaine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſecond is, that there are two principles of our faith, the one, that God is true, and the Author of truth, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that theſe thinges which we belieue are ſpoken and reuealed vnto vs by God. There is leſſe difficulty of the former
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4518:102"/> principle. For all who con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Ad Heb. 6. v.</hi> 18.</note> cannot be deceyued. Hereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle taketh this as a principle manifeſtly knowne by it ſelfe, It is impoſſible for God to lye.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the doubts and difficulties which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yue concerning matters of faith do eſpecially ariſe of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to wit, becauſe we know not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that ſuch things as we belieue, are reuealed by God: for hence ariſeth the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy with <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> &amp; <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</hi> For all do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that God is true, but the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſay, that their <hi>Alcora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by God, the <hi>Iewes</hi> their <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> their bible, corrupted &amp; maymed by them; the <hi>Anti-trinitarians</hi> their blaſphemies vttered againſt the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity;</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> their opinions, the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> theirs, and the <hi>Catholikes</hi> theirs. And hence it is, that we need greatly <hi>ſome ſure foundation, principle, rule,</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> whereby we may know certainly which is the doctrine indeed reuealed by God, and which is not, otherwiſe our fayth
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4518:103"/> will alwayes remayne doubtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The third is, that God is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med three wayes to aſſure his Church of this his reuelation. The firſt way is, when God himſelfe appeareth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen and ſpeaketh to his Church, for ſo in times paſt he ſpake vnto all the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he gaue them the tables of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod. 20. v.</hi> 22.</note> his Law in the mount <hi>Sinay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſecond is, when God ſpeaketh to one alone from heauen, and he ſendeth him to the Church, that he may reueale vnto the whole Church ſuch things as God hath ſpoken vnto him. So in tymes paſt in the old Teſtament God ſpake by<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod. 24. v. 2. 3. Ad Gal. 2. v.</hi> 12.</note> himſelfe to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and <hi>Moyſes</hi> reuealed the ſame things to the people. And in the new Teſtament <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed his Ghoſptell to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> which he afterward reuealed vnto others. But theſe two wayes are extraordinary, and are ceaſed, as all do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, excepting only a few <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Swenkfeldians,</hi> whoſe madneſſe and folly all men diſproue.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The third way is ordinary, which alwayes remaineth in the Church, and whereof the whole controuerſy is. For almoſt all <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; the <hi>purer ſort</hi> of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts</hi> will haue the ſole Scripture to be

Laſtly, albeit Infidels ſhould burne all the Bibles, yet the faith of Chriſtians ſhould not therfore periſh, or be wholy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne.

The third argument is, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes proue the Church and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof by the Scripture, therfore Scripture is rather the ground of fayth then the Church.

For not only the Apoſtolicall Scripture is the ground of our faith, but all the doctrine of the Apoſtles. And few of the twelue Apoſtles, to wit, only fiue, haue written any thing, but of the other ſeauen, there are no writings extant, but yet they all taught; the Apoſtle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaketh of the Apoſtolicall doctrine

For of the bare teſtimony he had ſpoken a little before. <hi>You ſent vnto Iohn, and he hath giuen teſtimony to truth.</hi> But this was a bare teſtimony: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt a little after ſaid, <hi>I haue a greater teſtimony then Iohn, for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to profit them: the very works which I do, giue teſtimony of me, that the Father hath ſent me. And the Father that ſent me, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath giuen teſtimony of me.</hi> All which ſaith. Chriſt of the teſtimony of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

                  <p n="4">4. But that the teſtimony of the

And by that alſo which we alleadged in the firſt diſputation, where we ſhew, that there is now no firme teſtimony wherby we may know certainly, which booke is canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and which not, beſides the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niy of the Catholike Church. For now neyther are the miracles wrought which God did in tymes paſt, neyther doth God ſpeake immediatly by himſelfe, as he ſpake in the baptiſme and transfiguration of Chriſt. VVherefore there remayneth only the third ordinary manner, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God ſpeaketh by the mouth of the Church.

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Argumentes of our Aduerſaryes are confuted.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt argument of our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries is: The Church is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the word of God; and by the word alſo of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, nouriſhed, and gouerned, and it is ſubiect to the word of God as to the words of her ſpouſe. I anſwere, our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do in a manner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found the writen word of God, with the word of God in generall, the which they ſhould not doe: for ther are three ſorts of the word of God to wit, that which is belieued, preached, and written. The belieued word is in the hart of the Church, that which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4518:126"/> is in her mouth, and that which is written is in her bookes. Of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and preached Word, the Apoſtle ſayth: <hi>the word is in thy mouth, and in thy hart, this is the word of fayth which we preach.</hi> We<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. 20. v.</hi> 8.</note> confeſſe, that in the belieued and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched word the Church is founded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the ſame it is ingendred, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. 10. v. 10. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. v.</hi> 14.</note> and gouerned, and that vnto this word it is ſubiect and obedient, as vnto the Words of her ſpouſe. For indeed this kind of word is neceſſary for the Church. <hi>For with our hart</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue vnto Iuſtice, but with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſaluation.</hi> And againe: <hi>How shall they heare without a preacher?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the nature of the written word is farre different; for this is neyther alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather neceſſary for the Church, ſeeing that the Church was without it more then two thouſand yeares; neyther can the written word be profitable to the Church, vnleſſe it be alſo rightly preached, and belieued. For what doth it profit a man to haue the Bible, vnleſſe he rightly belieue and vnderſtand it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the Scripture whereof we now diſpute, doth only conteyne the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, but the belieued and preached word is conteined in the viſible Church,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4518:126"/> as the neceſſary and eſſentiall parts therof: ſeing the one is as it were the life in the hart of the Church, the other as it were the ſpeach in her mouth: neither can they euer be ſeparated from her, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſaying and promiſe of God: <hi>The words which I haue put in thy mouth shall not</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. v. vlt.</note> 
                     <hi>depart from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy ſeede, nor from the mouth of thy ſeedes ſeede, from henceforth for euermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wherefore this argument doth proue the quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, for ſeeing that the written word receiueth it profit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the rightly belieued and preached word, which are the partes of the Church; it is neceſſary, that the written word receiue that authority and vtility from the Church, as that, wherin only the word rightly preached and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued is to be found.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſecond argument: If the Church ſhould teach any thing contrary to the Scriptures we were not to belieue the Church. Therefore the Scripture doth not receiue that authority from the Church, but rather the Church from the Scripture. I anſwere, that in the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner it may be ſaid, that if the Scripture ſhould conteine any thing againſt truth, we ſhould not alſo belieue it; if the holy
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:4518:127"/> Ghoſt ſhould vtter and ſpeake any lye, we ſhould not belieue him. But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are indeed impoſſible, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous againſt God; wherefore they are not only to be admitted, but not euen to be propoſed of Chriſtians. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Church ſhould teach any thing contrary to the Scriptures, for then the holy Ghoſt ſhould lye, becauſe he ſhould teach one thing by the Church, and the contrary by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The third argument, if the Scripture receiue that authority from the Church, then the Church ſhould be aboue the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: which ſeemeth to be very abſurd. I anſwere. That the Church is aboue the Scriptures, may be vnderſtood two wayes. Firſt, becauſe the Church exceedeth the Scripture in dignity and excellency, and in this ſenſe, without all doubt, the Church is about the Scripture, for the Scripture is made for the Church, and not contrary wiſe. <hi>All things</hi> (ſayth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles)<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor. 4. v.</hi> 51.</note> 
                     <hi>are done for you.</hi> Chriſt dyed for the Church, and not for the Scriptures: the Church belieueth, hopeth, loueth, and prayſeth God, but the Scripture doth none of theſe: The Church ſhall reigne and liue euerlaſtingly with Chriſt in heauen:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4518:127"/> the Scripture ſhall periſh after the day of Iudgement. Laſtly the Church contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it the word of God rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, preached, and the Holy Ghoſt it ſelfe, all which do farre exceede the written word in excellency and dignity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Secondly it may be vnderſtood that the Church is aboue the Scripture, ſo as ſhe may change the Scripture, or of Scripture make no Scripture, or laſtly ſhe may teach ſome what contrary to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or depart from the true ſenſe of Scripture: In which ſenſe the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of this tyme ſay, that we affirme the Church to be aboue the Scripture. And thus it is falſe that the Church is aboue the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: but neyther is there any Catholike which in this ſenſe will affirme that the<note place="margin">Bellar. l. 3. de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Dei c. vlt. in reſp. ad 14. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum.</note> Church is aboue the Scripture, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> truly affirmeth. For if the Church were in this ſenſe aboue the Scripture, the Church ſhould erre, and be oppoſite vnto her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elfe, becauſe in that the Church hath once approued the Scripture, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any more reiect and diſproue it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe contradict her ſelfe, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The fourth argument. The holy Scripture receiueth her authority imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from God himſelfe, becauſe he is the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4518:128"/> Author of the Scripture, therefore it doth not receiue it authority from the Church. I anſwere, there be two kinds of certaynties; the one of the thing in it owne Nature; the other in reſpect of vs: ſo alſo there are two kinds of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes; the one of the thing conſidered in it ſelfe, and this hath the Scripture from her principall Author, to wit, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: the other is in reſpect of vs, and this it hath from the Church; as we haue<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap 13. praeced. §. 17. &amp;</hi> 19.</note> proued before out of <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza.</hi> For we know not otherwiſe that God is the Author of the Scripture with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of fayth, but by the teſtimony of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And that which we haue ſayd of the Scripture, may alſo be euidently ſeene in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> who is aboue the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> was forced to proue his authority by miracles, that it might the better be knowen and allowed of men. For otherwiſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> had not beene bound to haue admitted his authority.<note place="margin">Ioan. 15. v. 14. S. Aug. Tom. 9. Tract. 91. in Ioan.</note> Hereupon, ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaking vnto his diſciples of the <hi>Iewes, If I had not done among them workes, that no other man hath done, they should not haue ſinned,</hi> that is to ſay, of Infidelity, not belieuing in Chriſt, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> very well expoundeth. And
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4518:128"/> in another place ſpeaking vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan. 10. v.</hi> 17.</note> he ſayth: <hi>If I doe not the workes of my Father, belieue me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. But if the authority of Chriſt which was moſt exellent in it ſelfe and immediatly from God, ſtood in need of thoſe meanes wherby it might become knowne vnto vs, to the end it might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige vs to belieue it; much more the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture will ſtand in need of it, albeit it be immediatly from God, to the end it be made manyfeſt vnto vs. For otherwiſe we ſhould not be obliged by the authority therof. But this is not done now by miracles, nor by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate or extraordinary reuelation of God: Therfore it reſteth that we ſay, it is done by the ordinary &amp; mediate reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, that is to ſay, by the Church, or rather by the holy Ghoſt, which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto vs by the Church.</p>

                  <p>SEING that there ariſe daily ſo many diſputations and Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes of matters of faith, none can deny, but that there muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4518:129"/> be ſome Iudge appointed, who muſt define, end, and determine ſuch Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſyes, for otherwiſe there will neuer be an end of ſuch matters. But it is a great difficulty who muſt be this Iudge. The Sectaries of this tyme almoſt all refuſe the Iudgment of the Church. For they ſee very well, that if they admit her as iudge, all their errors wilbe quite ouerthrowne. Wherfore ſome of them affirme, that the ſole Scripture muſt be the Iudge of all Controuerſies, and this was the firſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Aduerſaries, to wit, <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Zuinglius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But our later Aduerſaries when they conſider, that it is an abſurd thing to make the Scripture (being a thing<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap. 18. Controu.</hi> 1.</note> without life) the Iudge, as we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, they fly vnto their priuate ſpirit, the which they will haue the iudge of all Controuerſies. But leaſt they may ſeeme to attribute too much vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they endeauour to colour their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ſpirit with the famous title or name of the holy Ghoſt, affirming the holy Ghoſt to be the only iudge of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſyes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherfore there are three thinges heere to be proued. Firſt, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be Iudge. Secondly, that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4518:129"/> neyther the priuate ſpirit can be it. Thirdly, that the Catholike Church is the only, and moſt true Iudge of all Controuerſies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As concerning the firſt, wheras our Adu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>erſaries euery where teach, that nothing is to be belieued which is not expreſſely to be found in holy Scripture, it is a ſtrange thing, that they would perſwade men, that the Scripture is the Iudge of all Controuerſies: wheras we read no ſuch thing in any place of holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yea euen in theſe, teſtimony is only attributed to the Scriptures, and not Iudgment. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)<note place="margin">

But it is manifeſt, that the Scripture is ſuch a iudge, for it can neyther ſpeake nor heare: and ſo in like manner do all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes ancient and moderne alſo vſe the Scriptures. Laſtly almoſt all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries do ſee, how abſurd theſe things are, and therfore they fly vnto their owne priuate ſpirit, the which they call the holy Ghoſt.

                  <p n="8">8. As concerning therfore this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ſpirit, firſt there is none who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but that the holy Ghoſt is the chiefe Iudge of all Controuerſyes.

                  <p n="9">9. Moreouer it is certaine, that the holy Ghoſt doth not remayne, or is to be found in any booke (leaſt peraduenture our Aduerſaries ſhould ſend vs to their Bibles) but in the hartes of the belieuers. Now we aske, whether this holy Ghoſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4518:130"/> which is the Iudge of all, be in the hart of euery belieuer, or rather in the hart of the whole Catholike Church. If they ſay, in the hart of the Catholike Church, we haue our deſire: if they ſay in the hart of euery priuate man, it will follow that no priuate perſon can erre in his owne iudgment, ſeeing that the holy Ghoſt cannot erre in his iudgment.

                  <p n="10">10. Furthermore euery priuate man ſhallbe come the Iudge of the whole Church, if euery ſuch priuate perſon haue this ſpirit, which is the Iudge of the whole Church: whereupon there will enſue a great confuſion in the Church of God.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. Laſtly, that which they affirme that the priuate ſpirit of euery particuler perſon is Iudge, is therby declared to be falſe, that they themſelues acknowledge that there is no priuate man which at ſome tymes cannot erre in his indgment: but heere we inquire for a Iudge which cannot erre.

                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:4518:133"/> of our Aduerſaries: the firſt is, that the holy Ghoſt is not tyed vnto men, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>udgeth freely in whatſoeuer it pleaſeth him, therefore he is not tyed vnto the Church. But the ſame argument would proue, that there is no certainty in the holy Scriptures. For they who wrote the Scriptures were men, vnto whome, according to our Aduerſaries opinion, the holy Ghoſt was not tyed. I anſwere therfore, that the holy Ghoſt is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly bound, or tyed vnto men, but he is tyed to his owne promiſe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the words and promiſes of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For neither the holy Ghoſt, nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe can deceiue vs in not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their promiſes, becauſe as the Apoſtle<note place="margin">

                  <p n="28">28. The ſecond argument. If thoſe things which we haue ſaid of the Church as Iudge, were true, it would alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Church is Iudge of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4518:134"/> holy Scripture, and conſequently of the word of God in generall. I anſwere that the word of God in generall cannot be called in queſtion, or doubted of by any which profeſſeth Chriſt. For the diuine faith cannot be without ſome word of God, but where there is noe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy, there is no neede of any Iudge. But if of any one part of the word of God, whether it be written or not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, there ariſe any controuerſy, as for example, of the true ſenſe of the written word, without doubt we muſt recurre vnto the iudgement of the Church: for it belongeth vnto her to iudge of the trueſenſe of the holy Scripture, and of the expoſition thereof (which is the chiefer<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan. 14. v.</hi> 16.</note> part of the written word) as alſo of any doubtfull letter of the holy Scripture: for ſeeing that in times paſt, there haue beene many controuerſyes of diuers books of holy Scripture, and of the particuler Chapters and parts thereof, as alſo of the true ſenſe of the letter, and other written poynts of fayth, it is manifeſt, that no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> other Iudge but the Catholike Church hath ended or defined all theſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſyes.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. But in this iudgement of the Church there are two thinges to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4518:134"/> the one, that the Church doth not iudge of any part of the word of God out of her owne proper ſenſe and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at her owne pleaſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word of God, as her Aduerſaries, and namely <hi>Caluin,</hi> do wrongfully ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her: but by one part of the word of God which is better knowen, ſhe iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of that which is leſſe knowen, and manifeſt vnto vs: as for example by the word of God deliuered by Traditions, ſhe iudgeth of the written word of God, and of the true ſenſe therof.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. The other thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is, that when the Church doth iudge of theſe things they are not men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act. 15. v.</hi> 28.</note> which iudge as our Aduerſaries pretend, but the holy Ghoſt alſo himſelfe who iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and ſpeaketh vnto vs by the Church. <hi>It ſeemed good,</hi> ſay the Apoſtles, <hi>to the holy Ghoſt and vs.</hi> For euen as the actions of a mans body, are not ſo properly the actions of the body, as of the ſoule which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and moueth the body: ſo the actions of the whole Catholike Church, are not ſo much to be attributed vnto men, who are as it were the body of the viſible Church, as vnto the holy Ghoſt, who is as it were the ſoule which giueth life and motion to the body of the Church. They
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4518:135"/> therfore who deny this iudgment of the Church, are not only iniurious to the Church, but alſo to the holy Ghoſt.

Auguſtine;</hi> and our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries confeſſe this to be true when they treate of the Sacraments: Yea <hi>Caluin</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that this was alwaies as it were a matter of faith in the Church. And ſo do all teach now who are of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Truly none will ſay, that which
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4518:136"/> is only belieued in the Sacrament, is a ſigne, but that which is ſeene. But theſe ſignes of the Church preſcribed by our Aduerſaries can neyther be ſeen nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by any ſenſe. Yea not euen by our vnderſtanding, vnleſſe it be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fayth. For by faith only are they preceyued: becauſe none can know which is the ſincere preaching, lawfull admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcipline preſcribed by Chriſt, but by faith: wherefore they who ſay that theſe are the ſignes and markes of the Church do not indeed know what they ſay; euen as if one ſhould affirme, that in the Sacrament of baptiſme the ablution and the wordes are not ſignes, but the effect of baptiſme which is not ſeene, which euery man ſeeth how abſurd it is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſecond reaſon. Euery ſigne of any thing muſt be more manifeſt and better knowne, then the thing it ſelfe whoſe ſigne it is, becauſe it is put for that end that it may be a ſigne or token wherby that other thing may be known, but theſe ſignes of the Church alleadged by our Aduerſaries, are more obſcure and vncertaine then the Church it ſelf. For the Church is at the leaſt oftentymes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues confeſſe, but theſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4518:137"/> their ſignes be neuer viſible but alwaies inuiſible, for they can only be knowne by faith, as we haue already declared, but that which is by faith declared is neceſſarily obſcure, becauſe faith as witneſſeth the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb. 11. v.</hi> 1.</note> Apoſtle, <hi>is the argument of things not appearing,</hi> &amp; hence it is, that all ſectes do bragge and boaſt that they haue theſe ſignes, becauſe indeed they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be clearly ſeene of any.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The third reaſon. Our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do alledge in vayne theſe ſignes, for therfore do we enquire for ſignes and Markes of the Church, that they which are ignorant of her, may therby come to know her, for they who already know any thing do not need any ſignes, as for example, he who already knoweth very well this Citty needeth no marke or ſigne therof wherby he may know it. But he ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in need of ſignes who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaw this Citty. So in like manner they who are out of the Church and know her not, do moſt of all need ſome ſignes and markes wherby to know her, but theſe which our Aduerſaries aſſigne, can be knowne by none but by thoſe who are already within the Church and know her very well, hauing the true faith and beliefe therof, but they cannot be vnderſtood by thoſe who know not the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:4518:137"/> true Church, to the end they may ſeeke and fynd her, becauſe they are only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued and knowne by faith, they are therfore alleadged in vaine by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But neyther can theſe ſignes be knowne of all thoſe who are in the Church, but only of the more learned in the Church. For euery one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people cannot diſcerne which is the <hi>ſincere preaching of the word of God,</hi> or <hi>the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full adminiſtration of the Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall diſcipline</hi> preſcribed by the word of God, for it is neceſſary that he who knoweth all theſe things well, ſhould alſo vnderſtand almoſt all the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Moreouer there is as yet a very great controuerſy among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur Aduerſaries themſelues concerning theſe three ſignes, whiles that ſome of them doe contend, &amp; ſtriue, that this is the ſincere preaching of the word of God, others that ſome doe ſay that this is the lawfull adminiſtration of the Sacraments, others that ſome doe ſay, this is the diſcipline preſcribed by the word of God, others aſſigne another quite different from this.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But our Aduerſaries do in very truth confound the offices of the Church with the ſignes therof. For to preach ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely

                  <p n="8">8. But this is firſt to be preſuppoſed as it were the ground of all that we are to ſpeake of this matter. That euen natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon it ſelfe doth clearly demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrat, that there is ſome true Church of God heere vpon earth. For this is one of thoſe firſt principles of fayth, which are as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proued by naturall reaſon, as that there is a God. Wherefore the Apoſtle pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth theſe two amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the firſt grounds of our faith: <hi>he that commeth to God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>muſt belieue that he is, &amp; is a rewarder to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſeeke</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. The ſecond thing which enſueth is, that to theſe ſignes of the true Church theſe two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditious are altogeather neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.

                  <p n="2">2. The firſt ſigne of the true Church of Chriſt is <hi>Vnity.</hi> For there is a threefold vnity, neceſſarily preached in the Church
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4518:140"/> of Chriſt. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, of all the members with Chriſt, who is the ſupreme head of the Church, the which is effected by fayth; wherefore it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that there muſt be but one fayth of all the members of the Church. <hi>One Lord and God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and one faith,</hi> and againe, vntill we all meete in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<note place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſecond Vnity</hi> is of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers among themſelues: for as he who diſſolueth the firſt vnity is an heretike: ſo he, which violateth this is a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike: wherefore Chriſt ſayth, <hi>in this all men shall know that you are my diſciples, if you haue loue one to another.</hi> And the Apoſtle, <hi>That there might be no ſchiſme in the body, but the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That the Roman Church only, is the true Church of Christ, is proued by the properties of the true Church.</head>
                  <p>HITHERTO we haue deſcribed out of holy Scripture the true Church of Chriſt, and that by the properties, offices, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſignes therof. Now it remaineth that we by the ſame enquire and examine in what part or place of the world this true Church of Chriſt may be found, the which will eaſily be done, if we declare that all theſe propertyes, offices, and ſignes muſt needes agree to ſome one. We therefore do affirme that all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, properties, and ſignes of the true Church do only agree to the Roman Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is heere notwithſtanding to be conſidered, leaſt ſome perchance by the ambiguity or equiuocation of the word be deceyued, that we doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the Roman Church, that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4518:145"/> which is only at Rome, as our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries go about to perſwade the ignorant, but plainly euery Church which agreeth in the vnity of the ſame faith with the Roman, and which obeyeth the Biſhop of Rome, wherſoeuer that Church be, whether at Rome, or els where, yea euen the furtheſt part of the Indyes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that this Roman Church thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood is the only true Church of Chriſt, and conſequently that out of her we cannot hope for eternall ſaluation (ſeing that out of the true Church, as we<note place="margin">Cap. 1. buius Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ.</note> haue ſufficiently declared before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaued) we will euidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by all the properties, offices, and ſignes before alledged of the true Church. And firſt we will ſpeake of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to wit, of thoſe which agree vnto her <hi>quarto modo.</hi> For all theſe do very well agree to the Roman Church, and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The which we declare in this manner.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Firſt the Roman Church is the eſpouſe of Chriſt. For that ſhe was betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and eſpouſed vnto Chriſt by true<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, thoſe wordes of the holy Scripture do plainly teſtify: <hi>Your faith,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. 1. v.</hi> 8.</note> writing to the Romans, <hi>is renowned in the whole world.</hi> And a little after <hi>S. Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:4518:146"/> profeſſeth himſelfe to agree in the vnity of faith with the Roman Church, that is to profeſſe the Roman Faith, and not that of <hi>VVittemberge,</hi> as <hi>Luther,</hi> or that of <hi>Geneua,</hi> as <hi>Caluin</hi> did. Wherfore with good right we profeſſe our ſelues not only to be the children of the Catholike, but alſo of the Catholike Roman Church and faith, the which <hi>S. Paul</hi> alſo manifeſtly profeſſeth himſelfe to be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But our Aduerſaries obiect, that the Church of Rome in the Apoſtles tyme had the true faith, but afterward ſhe forſooke and loſt it. So in tymes paſt thoſe Heretikes which were called <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> when they were vrged by the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Catholikes, were wont to ſay, that indeed the Church of Rome was famous ouer all the world in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles tyme, but in their tyme ſhe peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in all the other partes of the world and remayned only among the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in<note place="margin">
                        <hi>S. Aug. Tom. 7. de vnit. Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Africke,</hi> whome <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> refuteth very well, and we imitating him herein will vſe this kind of argument: That the faith of the Roman Church was once the true and ſincere faith, the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth expreſly teſtify: but that the ſame Church afterward forſooke or loſt her former faith, is no where extant in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:4518:146"/> holy writ: therfore we muſt not belieue that which is ſo expreſly againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And this argument indeed vrgeth much more our Aduerſaries then the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> ſeing that they teach, that we muſt belieue nothing which is not expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly in Scripture, but this is no where to be found expreſſely therin, to wit, that the Roman Church forſooke or loſt her faith which ſhe had receyued from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And truly there can be no greater ſigne of the want of learning and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then to think that, that Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke and loſt her fayth, whoſe faith euen the expreſſe word of God doth ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend vnto vs, vnleſſe this her forſaking and looſing of her former true faith can be proued out of the ſame word of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Our Aduerſaries indeed ſay, that they will proue it in ſome particuler points of faith, but they will neuer be able to performe their promiſe, as in euery particuler Controuerſy will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Moreouer God promiſeth to this eſpouſe of Chriſt, by the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> the which he alſo confirmed with an Oath, that ſhe ſhould be inueſted and adorned

                  <p n="2">2. The firſt reaſon is taken from thoſe very ſignes which our Aduerſaries aſſigne, that is to ſay, the true and ſincere preaching of the word of God, and the lawfull adminiſtration of the Sacraments, which are indeed offices and not ſignes of the Church, as we hane ſayd before; but whether they be ſignes or offices, by them it is euidently proued that the Romane Church and no other is the true Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares laſt paſt the Sacraments were no where lawfully adminiſtred, nor the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:4518:150"/> word of God ſincerely preached, but in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For our Aduerſaries cannot name any Church, wherein theſe things haue beene done. Therefore eyther the <hi>Roman</hi> is the true Church, or els Chriſt hath had no Church for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares and more.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. And heere it is diligently to be conſidered that this doth not happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Aduerſaries by a meere chaunce only, or by the malice of ſome few of them as they ſay it doth, but euen neceſſarily out of the nature and condition of their doctrine. For they teach, that there ſhould be no Superiour vnto whom all ſhould be obedient and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: no iudge of Controuerſyes, whoſe iudgment and definition in thoſe matters all ſhould imbrace or follow; beſides that euery one teacheth what he liſteth, and euery one of them diſdayneth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or corrected by another, wherby there muſt needes ariſe many iarres and contentions among them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But in the Roman Church it is far otherwiſe. For if there ariſe any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or Controuerſy which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined

But if the matter be obſcure and cannot eaſily be gathered out of the word of God, nor be very neceſſary to ſaluation, then the Roman Church commaundeth both parties that one of them do not condemne the others opinion, as we ſee practiſed concerning the Conception of the <hi>B.

                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6. But Catholikes teach theſe fiue things of the generall Councells. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that a generall Councell cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word of God make any new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of fayth, but her office is to explicate clearly and propoſe the word of God to be belieued of all, the which the Church hath receaued from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.

                  <p n="7">7. The ſecond is, that we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug. To<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 7. de Baptiſ. cont.

The third is, that we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thoſe Councells may erre, which eyther are not lawfully aſſembled, or do not proceed lawfully in their buſines they haue in hand.

                  <p n="11">11. And hence it is, that the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> demanded her confirmation from <hi>Pius</hi> 4. who ſolemnely afterward confirmed it.

                  <p n="12">12. The fifth is, that we affirme a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> approued by the Pope, cannot erre in fayth. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is altogeather neceſſary, that there be ſome ſupreme iudgment in the Church of God wherunto all ſhould ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and belieue aſſuredly in all matters in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy, as we haue proued before: but there can be no other ſupreme iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p n="15">15. Moreouer that which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries ſay, to wit, that the later Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are not lawfull Aſſemblies, becauſe they haue not obſerued due manner and forme, is a falſe lye: firſt becauſe it doth not become euery priuate man, to

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Authority of the auncient Holy Fathers.</head>
                  <p>NOw it remaineth we ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the auncient holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of their writinges, both becauſe they were in tymes paſt the chiefeſt members of the true Church of Chriſt, euen by the confeſſion of our Aduerſaries, as alſo becauſe in the particuler controuerſies we ſhall often vſe the teſtimonies &amp; authorities of the holy Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We know indeed well inough that they were men, and that they might haue erred (but neyther are they Gods nor Angells, who accuſe them of their errors). We know alſo that one or more of the ſayd holy Fathers haue ſometymes erred, when they left the more common opinion of others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But we affirme this conſtantly, that the auncient holy Fathers recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Church of God, haue neuer written any thing with a common and vnanime conſent, that is eyther contrary
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:4518:189"/> to the holy Scriptures, or to any point of fayth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Moreouer out of the writings of the holy Fathers in foure diuers manners ſome forcible and conuincing arguments may be taken.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Firſt, out of the common conſent of all, or at the leaſt of the moſt part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction at all. For if they had all erred in a neceſſary point of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the whole auncient Church ſhould alſo haue erred, the which euen our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<note place="margin">Cap. 7. huius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. Secondly, that promiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. Thirdly, Paſtors and Doctors<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ad Epheſ. 4. v 11. 12. &amp; 13. &amp;</hi> 14.</note> were ordained by God in his Church, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, to the end, that we be not <hi>carried about with euery wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> but that we may continue in <hi>the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſayth, till we meet with Chriſt,</hi> in the laſt day. But if all the Paſtors and Doctors of the Church could erre, we might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:4518:190"/> be carried away with many blaſtes of ſtrange doctrines, neyther could the <hi>vnity of fayth</hi> alwayes continue: and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God ſhould haue prouided very bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his Church, that it ſhould neuer erre.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Finally, if all the <hi>Paſtors and Doctors</hi> of the Church ſhould teach any doctrine contrary to fayth, there ſhould no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and true preaching of the word of God remayne in the Church, ſeeing that only <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> are lawfully called to the preaching of the true fayth of God. But without the ſincere preaching of the<note place="margin">

                  <p n="9">9. Secondly, we take arguments out of the auncient holy Fathers, as out of moſt faythfull and true witneſſes of that fayth which in their tymes was preached in the Catholike Church. For our Aduerſaries acknowledge, that in their tyme the true and ſincere fayth of Chriſt was preached. We therefore alledge them as witneſſes of that fayth: for if we do not belieue them who lieued at that time, whom will we belieue? but they were both eye witneſſes, and nothing ſuſpected of falſhood, as <hi>S.

                  <p n="10">10. Thirdly, we take arguments out<note place="margin">S. Aug. Tom. 7. cont.

                  <p n="11">11. Eourthly, we take arguments out of the holy Fathers, as out of the moſt holy and learned men and Bleſſed Saints of God.
